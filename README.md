# pycaruna

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pycaruna.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pycaruna)

Basic Python implementation for interfacing with Caruna Plus (sometimes called _Caruna+_). It supports only basic 
methods, but enough to extract electricity usage data for further processing.

Supported features:

* Log in with the plus.caruna.fi email and password (not Suomi.fi)
* Get user profile information
* Get metering points ("assets")
* Get consumption data (daily/hourly)

Login failures raise `CarunaAuthError`. Connectivity and unexpected HTTP/JSON failures raise `CarunaApiError`.

## Usage

The project is published on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pycaruna/ . You can use this package by adding the 
following to your `requirements.txt`:

```
pycaruna
```

The `examples/` directory has example Python programs illustrating how to use the library.

The `resources/` directory has examples of API response structures.

## Caveats

* The authentication procedure requires a lot of HTTP requests to be sent back and forth, so the process is 
  relatively slow. It's best to store and reuse the token produced by it (`expiresAt`, typically ~60 minutes)
  instead of doing the authentication process all over again all the time.
* The login form action is no longer hardcoded. The client reads the live Wicket action and accepts either
  an `Ajax-Location` header or an XML `<redirect>` after posting credentials.
* ~~During daylight savings time changes, the API may return a duplicate datapoint (same timestamp in two consecutive 
  data points). See https://github.com/Jalle19/pycaruna/issues/7 for more details.~~ This has reportedly been fixed, see
